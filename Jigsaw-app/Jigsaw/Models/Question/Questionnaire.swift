/// Questionnaire is [Question], i.e. an array of questions.
/// - Note: Since we have 6 types of questions now, a questionnaire should not be
///         an array of `Any`. Instead it is an array of objects that all conform to a
///         protocol, which in this case is `QuestionEssentialProperty`.
