[Jigsaw](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/MobileCenter/jigsaw) helps reduce bias and miscommunication among people with different political stances.

Originally prototyped by Grant Larson, Mengqian Liu, Shaopeng Zhang and Diego Chamorro, the app was later on continued by Xinyi Hong and Xiaochen Zhou at *Duke's Center for Mobile Development*. Based on previous efforts, Ting(@yo1995) refactored the app and made it public on GitHub. 

The app is sponsored by Department of Philosophy at Duke.

Currently the app is under beta testing.
